                    <h1>About Non-Biodegradable Waste</h1>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        A Non-Biodegradable material can be defined as a kind of substance which cannot be broken down by natural organisms and acts as a source of pollution.
                        Unlike biodegradable wastes, non-biodegradable cannot be easily handled. Non-biodegradable wastes are those who cannot be decomposed or dissolved by natural agents. They remain on earth for thousands of years without any degradation. Hence, the threat caused by them is also more critical. A notable example is the plastics which are a commonly used material in almost every field. To give these plastics a long lasting effect, improved quality plastics are being put to use. This made them more temperature resistant and more durable even after use. Other examples are cans, metals, and chemicals for agricultural and industrial purposes. They are the main causes of air, water and soil pollution and diseases like cancer.
                        Since non-biodegradable wastes are not Eco-friendly, they need to be replaced. As a part of a development of alternatives, scientists have brought forward many ides like biodegradable plastics, etc. They incorporated some biodegradable materials with plastics and made them easily and rapidly degradable. But this is quite an expensive procedure.
                        <br>
                        Waste that cannot be decomposed by the biological processes is known as “Non-biodegradable wastes”. Most of the inorganic waste is non-biodegradable. Non-biodegradable wastes that can be recycled are known as “Recyclable waste” and those which cannot be recycled are known as “Non-recyclable waste”.

                    Management of waste involves steps right from the generation to disposal of the treated waste. For non biodegradable waste, special care has to taken during collection, storage, transport, and disposal—all separated from general biodegradable and non-hazardous waste. 
                    In India, the State Pollution Control Boards of respective states, centrally governed by the Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Climate Change are responsible for all waste management in the country. Following steps are undertaken by the municipalities for non biodegradable waste management. 
                    The municipal corporations set up Non biodegradable waste collection centres in specific wards or divisions where the waste is temporarily stored before further processing.
                    Segregation of waste is carried out by hiring rag pickers and segregation. NBW is taken for a separate treatment process.
                    Both types of waste are kept in different receptacles with different colour codes for easy identification by the common person. 
                    Separate vehicles or at least separate receptacles are provided for the transport of waste. The vehicles must be covered to avoid spillage of waste.
                    The municipalities also provide for various ways of disposal of waste which operate in a scientific manner with provision for recycling and landfills.

                    Refuse, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle the best policy for reducing non-biodegradable waste. 
                    The segregated non biodegradable waste goes for processing and treatment to specific waste treatment plants. There they are recycled.
                    Usually, the treatment of non-biodegradable waste is done on the basis of nature of the material it is made up of. We will discuss the procedures according to the major types of recycled waste.
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Iron materials: Among metals, Iron is the most recycled one. It can be easily separated by magnetic methods, molten in a furnace and used for the production of other iron materials or steel. The resultant iron or steel is of lower quality but can be used for producing cheaper materials where the low quality of the same is needed. </li>
                        <li>Non-Iron materials: Other metals like Aluminium, copper, and alloys like brass etc. These materials are ground into fine pieces and molten to be recast in new materials.</li>
                        <li>Glass: Things like glass bottles, jars, etc. are crushed, decolourized and put into the furnace for melting. This can be remoulded into bottles of required shape and size or can be used for layering on roads as glassphalt. </li>
                        <li>Plastic: There are various types and grades of plastics that all cannot be mixed together for treatment. The plastic waste has to be sorted, and the plastics can be further remoulded and used for making new materials. </li>
                        <li>Recycling paper and wood has become a popular option and is used to make many new things like plywood, recycled paper, cardboard, etc. it plays a key role in the prevention of deforestation.  </li>
                    </ol>    
                </br>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Let’s look at some non biodegradable waste management methods. For biodegradable waste, landfilling, composting are the most widely used methods.
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Incineration: Usually used for non-recyclable non biodegradable waste, biohazardous waste from hospitals, etc. It involves decomposition of waste using high heat, i.e. above 500⁰C. The residual ash contains metals which can be recovered using separate treatments. </li>
                        <li>Sanitary Landfills: These are similar to landfills but are built in a planned and methodical way. Normal landfills do not prevent leaching or leakage of waste and toxic substance along with water into the ground. Sanitary landfills are built using concrete, are closed areas with facilities to collect the leachate and gases released. These also prevent pest breeding and pathogen spread. </li>
                        <li>Plasma arc furnaces: These are specialized furnaces which directly convert waste to plasma, the fourth state of matter. </li>
                        <li>Encapsulation: In this method, the waste is packed compactly in an inert cover called a capsule, which does not allow any exchange of gases other substances. These capsules can be used for burying the waste deep down into the ground. </li>
                    </ol>    
                </br>
                </p>
            </div>

                    Management of non biodegradable waste in India has improved since the implementation of Swachh Bharat Mission and other laws in the past six years. 
                    The Swachh Bharat Mission was launched to make India free of open defecation and for improving solid waste management (SWM) in the country. It increased door to door collection of waste for more than 80,000 wards in India. It has increased the waste processing at the site of generation or collection up to 65%. 
                    <br>
                    The Ministry of Environment executed a new set of rules called Solid Waste Management Rules in 2016. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>It mandates the segregation of waste into dry, wet, hazardous waste at the source itself. It makes having minimum two separate bins for biodegradable and non biodegradable waste at residential, institutional places.</li>
                        <li>Organizations that generate a large amount of organic waste are directed to treat it on-site. This includes hotels, industries, etc.</li>
                        <li>The key highlight of this law involved local rag pickers in providing them with a source of employment and in permitting them to collect non biodegradable waste to be recycled. </li>
                        <li>A special provision for packaging waste like cardboard boxes, plastics, etc. during the transport of goods was allowed. The companies using such non biodegradable packaging material are supposed to develop methods of collecting that waste and treating or recycling it further. </li>
                        <li>Waste having energy more than or equal to 1,500 kcal/kg has to be first treated for energy recovery before landfilling it. </li>
                    </ul>
